`hex` is a simple hex viewer for the console.

I needed a simple Unix program for teaching and this was the first thing
I thought to write.

As far as I need, this is feature complete.

Feel free to use it if you need. There's a tarball in the `Releases` tab.

Remove the `pledge(2)` calls if you're not on OpenBSD.
